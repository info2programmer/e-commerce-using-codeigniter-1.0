								<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;BIVA Publication started on December 24, 2014 as a publishing company with the mission of publishing high-quality books to suit every palate at affordable prices. Our founder’s vision is to establish a highly reputed and trust worthy publishing brand, capable to create internationally competitive books in Bengali with a price tag even lesser than a packet of cigarette, so that knowledge does not remain the prerogative of just a few people. Now BIVA Publication is expanding its business to other languages and other fields of literally works as well through various innovative and planned initiatives and executions.</p></br>
								<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, BIVA Publication is a fastest growing book publishing companies in Bengal, not only publish quality books, it also offers various self-publishing, Magazine Printing, Cover Design and online-offline Distribution services to both authors and publishers from around the world.</p></br>
								<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our books offer something for readers of every age. We truly value the innocence of imagination. The lack of imagination in today generations makes them more mechanic rather than spontaneous. And what else other than book can let you travel to a world that we cannot enter in any other way. Whenever you read a book, somewhere in the world a door opens to allow in more light. Even the wildest fairy tales are more than true, not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons also can be beaten. Hence our tag line “Imagination! Xperience ours, Xplore yours.” held high with this ideology.</p>
